INTRODUCTION
============

ivCalc is an IV calculator for the Pokemon Diamond, Pearl, Platinum, Heart Gold, Soul Silver, Black and White games. It's objective is to provide ranges of possible IVs for a combination of level, nature, stats and base stats.

The calculator is using a somewhat naive method for now, but it works VERY fast on Google Chrome, so I recommend using it (actually, I recommend chrome over all the other browsers for *almost* everything). But considering the other browser's engines, I suppose you will be alright with whatever choice you have - that is, if you don't use Internet Explorer. (if you do: Good luck)

USE
===

This software is made in JavaScript (with minor uses of the jQuery library) and can be used from any browser that supports it. This version doesn't contain database information for pokemon attacks and stats. Also, you can use this calculator in your own projects, according to the license in use (MIT License).

Any issue or trouble can be emailed to me at:
